# ✅ Final Fixes Summary

## 🎯 All Issues Fixed!

### 1. ✅ Fixed Position Navbar
**Issue:** Navbar was disappearing when scrolling  
**Fix:** Added `fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50` to navbar  
**Result:** Navbar now stays visible at all times

### 2. ✅ Active Tab Highlighting  
**Issue:** Navbar didn't show which page you're on  
**Fix:** Used `useLocation()` to detect current route and highlight active tab  
**Result:** Current page is always highlighted in navbar

### 3. ✅ API URL Configuration
**Issue:** API calls going to `localhost:5000` instead of Azure backend  
**Fix:** Set default fallback to Azure URL in all components  
**Result:** All API calls now go to `https://clothstoreapiapp.azurewebsites.net`
